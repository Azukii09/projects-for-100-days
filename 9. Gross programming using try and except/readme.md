## 💡Hint
1. The **_quit()_** function is used to exit a python program. When it encounters the quit() function in the system, it terminates the execution of the program completely.

2. It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. In Python, a value is the information that is stored within a certain object. To encounter a **_ValueError_** in Python means that is a problem with the content of the object you tried to assign the value to.

Happy Coding! 🚀✨
