# Score Checker Project

## 📚 **Instructions**
Write a program that prompts the user for a **score** between **0.0 and 1.0**. If the score is out of range, the program should print an **error message**. If the score is within the valid range, it should print a **grade** based on the following table:

| **Grade** | **Score** |
|-----------|-----------|
| A         | >= 0.9    |
| B         | >= 0.8    |
| C         | >= 0.7    |
| D         | >= 0.6    |
| E         | < 0.6     |
