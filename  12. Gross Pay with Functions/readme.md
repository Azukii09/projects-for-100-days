# Gross Pay with Functions Project

## 📄 Instruction
Rewrite Gross Pay with Try Except Project (Project Day 9) and create a function called compute_pay which takes two parameters (hours and rate). Additionally, we need to create another function which checks if the type of "input" is a float or not. If the values for hour or rate is not float we will return error.

Hint: overtime = hour - 40

### 📝 Input
>1
>```
>Enter Hours: 35
>Enter Rate ($): 5

>2
>```
>Enter Hours: 45
>Enter Rate ($): 5
